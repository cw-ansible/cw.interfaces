# List of interfaces files to generate
#
# Each file is defined by a dictionary of:
#
#  - "file": the name of the file to generate.
#  - "data": a list of parts of the interfaces file to be generated.
#
# Each "data" item consists of:
#
#  - "iface": name of the interfaces. In addition of standard keywords, the
#    "iface" data also understand:
#    - "comment": A comment for that interface.
#    - "hostname": The hostname to be set when the interface if configured
#      (work only for static method).
#      If the "hostname" is a host name, /etc/hostname will be set to its
#      value, an the extra line is added to /etc/hosts for convenience:
#        ADDR host1.example.com host1 localhost-IFACE localhost-IFACE.localdomain
#      If the hostname is "yes", only the followin extra line is added to
#      /etc/hosts:
#        ADDR localhost-IFACE localhost-IFACE.localdomain
#    - "type": how the interface is configured. By default "auto", can be
#      "allow-*". If interface is "lo" the type is set to "auto:.  See
#      interfaces(5) for further details.
#    - "method": how to configure the interface: loopback, static, dhcp or
#      manual. By default the method is dhcp except if an "address" is
#      provided. If interface is "lo" the method is set to loopback.
#    - "family": inet by default, use inet6 for IPv6.
#    - "routes": An alias to configure static routes when interface is bring
#      UP. Each route is a dictionary with a "network" and a "gateway"
#      parameter.
#      Each route will generate a "post-up" line for the interface entry.
#  - "mapping", "source", "source-directory": act like described in
#    interface(5) manpage.
#
# The following example generates the interfaces file as given in the man
# page:
#
# interfaces_network_interfaces:
#   - file: /etc/network/interfaces
#     data:
#     - iface: eth0
#     - source: interfaces.d/machine-dependent
#     - source-directory: interfaces.d
#     - mapping: eth0
#       script: /usr/local/sbin/map-scheme
#       map:
#         - HOME eth0-home
#         - WORK eth0-work
#     - iface: eth0-home
#       address: 192.168.1.1
#       netmask: 255.255.255.0
#       up: flush-mail
#     - iface: eth0-work
#     - iface: eth1
#       type: allow-hotplug
#   # Other examples
#   - file: /etc/network/interfaces.d/extra
#     data:
#     - iface: lo
#     - iface: lo:1
#       address: 127.10.10.1
#       netmask: 255.255.255.255
#     - iface: eth2
#       method: manual
#       auto vmbr0
#     - iface: vmbr2
#       bridge_ports: eth2
#       bridge_stp: 'off'
#       bridge_fd: 0
#       routes:
#         - { network: 172.19.0.0/17, gateway: 172.18.127.254 }
#         - { network: 172.19.192.0/22 gateway: 172.18.127.1 }
